--- Represents an input.
--- @class Input
---
--- The input code as a string.
--- @field Code InputCode
---
--- The input's value.
--- For keys and other digital inputs (on or off), this is either 0 or 1.
--- For analog inputs, this ranges from 0-1.
--- @field Value number|Vec2
---
--- How much the input has changed. Especially useful for movement and joysticks.
--- @field Delta number|Vec2
---
--- Which gamepad/player this came from (always 1 for keyboard/mouse)
--- @field UserIndex number

--- Library relating to various input-related things
--- @class InputLib
Input = {}

--- Connect a callback to when an input begins. Call the returned function once to disconnect the callback.
--- @overload fun(code: InputCode, callback: fun(input: Input))
--- @param callback fun(input: Input)
--- @return fun()
function Input.OnBegin(callback) end

--- Connect a callback to when an input ends. Call the returned function once to disconnect the callback.
--- @overload fun(code: InputCode, callback: fun(input: Input))
--- @param callback fun(input: Input)
--- @return fun()
function Input.OnEnd(callback) end

--- Connect a callback to when an input changes (like mouse movement). Call the returned function once to disconnect the callback.
--- @param callback fun(input: Input)
--- @return fun()
function Input.OnChange(callback) end

--- Checks if an input is down.
--- @param code InputCode
function Input.IsDown(code) end

--- Gets an input's value.
--- @param code InputCode
function Input.GetValue(code) end
